  description: 'Scientific Name: Psychrolutes marcidus



    Nickname: "World''s
    Ugliest Animal" (due to its, often-misunderstood, appearance when caught)



    Habitat:
    Deep ocean floors (2,000 to 4,000+ feet or 600-1,200+ meters) off the coasts
    of Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand.



    Physical Characteristics: Underwater:
    Looks like a normal fish with a large head, tapered body, and dark eyes; surface
    appears as a blob-like, gelatinous mass due to decompression damage.

    Size:
    Typically less than 1 foot (30 cm) long.



    Diet: "Lie-in-wait" predator;
    eats crustaceans, mollusks, sea urchins, and sea pens that drift into its mouth.



    Lifespan:
    Estimated to be up to 130 years.



    The blobfish (Psychrolutes marcidus)
    is a deep-sea fish found off the coasts of Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand.
    It lives at depths of 600 to 1,200 meters, where extreme pressure makes traditional
    swim bladders ineffective.



    Instead, the blobfish has a gelatinous body
    with a density slightly less than water, allowing it to float just above the
    seafloor with minimal energy use. Although it has little muscle, this suits its
    lifestyle, as it feeds mainly on small deep-sea crustaceans drifting within reach.'
