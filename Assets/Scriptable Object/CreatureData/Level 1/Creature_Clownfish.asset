    Indo-Pacific, living in shallow lagoons.



    Physical Characteristics: Stocky,
    oval body; typically orange with three white bars outlined in black, though variations
    exist (e.g., black, yellow).



    Size: Up to 11 cm (4.3 inches) for common
    species.

    and debris from their host anemone.



    Lifespan: 6-10 years in the wild,
    longer in captivity



    Clownfish, also known as anemonefishes (Amphiprion),
    are small saltwater fish found in warm tropical Indo-Pacific coral reefs. They
    are easily recognized by their bright colors with white vertical stripes and
    live in a mutually beneficial relationship with sea anemones, which provide protection
    while clownfish defend, clean, and support the anemone.



    Clownfish are
    omnivorous, feeding mainly on plankton, and live in structured groups led by
    a dominant breeding female. They have a unique social system where the breeding
    male can change sex if the female is lost, and reproduction occurs near their
    host anemone before larvae disperse into the open ocean and later settle as juveniles.
