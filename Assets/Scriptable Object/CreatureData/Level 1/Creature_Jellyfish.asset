  description: 'Common Names: Compass Jellyfish, Red-banded Jellyfish, Sea Nettle.



    Scientific
    Name: Chrysaora hysoscella



    Habitat: Coastal waters of the North Atlantic,
    North Sea, English Channel, and Mediterranean Sea.



    Physical Characteristics:
    Translucent, yellowish-white bell with 16 distinct reddish-brown V-shaped marks
    pointing inward, plus a central spot.



    Size: Bell diameter up to 30 cm
    (12 inches).



    Tentacles: 24 thin marginal tentacles (in 8 groups of 3)
    and 4 longer, frilly oral arms.



    Diet: Small fish, crabs, other jellyfish,
    plankton, and marine invertebrates.



    Lifespan: Their entire life as a medusa
    (the free-swimming jellyfish stage) often lasts around a year.



    The compass
    jellyfish (Chrysaora hysoscella) is a common true jellyfish found in temperate
    coastal waters of the northeastern Atlantic, including the North Sea and Mediterranean
    Sea. It is easily recognized by the brown, V-shaped markings on its bell and
    has a life cycle that includes a seabed polyp stage before developing into a
    free-swimming adult.



    Feeding on plankton and small marine invertebrates,
    the compass jellyfish has few natural predators and is often affected by a parasite
    without major population impact. Its growing numbers contribute to jellyfish
    overpopulation, which can interfere with recreation, disrupt fishing activities,
    and affect marine ecosystems.
