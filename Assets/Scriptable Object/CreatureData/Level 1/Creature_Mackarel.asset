  description: "Common Names: Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), Chub mackerel
    (Scomber japonicus), Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta), and King mackerel
    (Scomberomorus cavalla).\n\r\nScientific Name: Scomber scombrus\n\r\nHabitat:
    Temperate and tropical seas worldwide, living in large schools near the surface
    or in shallow coastal waters, ranging down to 1,600 meters depth.\n\r\nPhysical
    Characteristics: They possess a streamlined, torpedo-shaped body with a deeply
    forked tail, allowing for high-speed swimming (up to 50 km/h).\n\r\nSize: Generally
    30\u201370 cm in length, though species like the King mackerel can exceed 170
    cm.\n\r\nWeight: Common species weigh between 0.7\u20131.3 kg, while large game
    species can reach up to 45 kg.\n\r\nDiet: Carnivorous predators, feeding on small
    fish, crustaceans, squid, and plankton.\n\r\nLifespan: Commonly live up to 9
    years, with some species living up to 20 years.\r\n\r\nMackerel are pelagic fish
    from the family Scombridae, found in temperate and tropical seas where they live
    along coasts and in open ocean waters. They are easily recognized by their forked
    tails and green-blue, tiger-like stripes, and many species migrate in large schools
    to shallow coastal areas to spawn before returning to feeding grounds or deeper
    waters.\n\r\nMackerel play an important role in the marine food chain, serving
    as prey for seabirds, whales, dolphins, sharks, and large predatory fish such
    as tuna. Rich in omega-3 oils, they are heavily harvested by humans, with millions
    of tons caught annually, and are also prized by sport fishermen for their strong
    fighting ability."
