    for camouflage.

    The giant Pacific
    octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini) is the largest octopus species in the world,
    inhabiting the cold, nutrient-rich waters of the North Pacific Ocean. Its range
    extends from Baja California up through the western coast of North America and
    across to Russia, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula, living from shallow intertidal
    zones down to depths of about 2,000 meters.



    This highly intelligent cephalopod
    plays an important role in maintaining marine ecosystem balance and is widely
    studied in cognitive research. Due to its size and adaptability, the giant Pacific
    octopus is also commonly seen in aquariums and contributes significantly to both
    scientific research and regional fisheries.'
