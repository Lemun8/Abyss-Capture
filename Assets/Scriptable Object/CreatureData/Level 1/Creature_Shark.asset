    The
    great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) is the largest living predatory fish,
    recognized by its gray upper body, white underside, and rows of sharp, serrated
    teeth. Found in tropical and temperate oceans worldwide, it is a powerful, partially
    warm-blooded hunter that feeds on fish, other sharks, marine mammals, and carrion,
    and is capable of long-distance migrations across entire oceans.



    Despite
    its fearsome reputation in popular culture, great white sharks rarely attack
    humans and are typically solitary, gathering only at feeding sites. The species
    is ovoviviparous, with pups born live after developing inside the mother, and
    juveniles remain in shallow waters until large enough to hunt bigger prey. Currently
    listed as vulnerable, great white sharks face threats from fishing, bycatch,
    and habitat pressure, leading to global conservation efforts to protect them.'
