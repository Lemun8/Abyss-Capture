  description: 'Scientific Name: Lophius piscatorius



    Habitat: Found globally,
    from shallow coastal waters (like the Monkfish) to the deep sea (mesopelagic/bathypelagic
    zones), often on muddy or sandy bottoms.



    Physical Characteristics: Often
    have flattened, scaleless bodies, huge heads, wide mouths, and sharp teeth; deep-sea
    species are typically dark-colored.



    Size: Varies greatly; some large species
    (like Monkfish) reach 2 meters, while deep-sea types are smaller, with females
    significantly larger than males.



    Diet: Carnivores, eating fish, crustaceans
    (like shrimp), and even small sea birds, using their lure to draw prey close
    before engulfing them.



    Lifespan: Short, typically 3-5 years.



    Anglerfish
    are ray-finned fishes belonging to the order Lophiiformes, named for their unique
    hunting method in which a modified dorsal fin acts as a lure to attract prey.
    This lure, consisting of the illicium and its glowing tip called the esca, varies
    across species and is adapted to draw in specific prey through different visual
    or bioluminescent signals.

    Found worldwide, anglerfish inhabit a wide range
    of environments, from shallow coastal waters to the deep sea, where many species
    are either bottom-dwellers or pelagic. They are also famous for extreme sexual
    dimorphism, with tiny males attaching to much larger females in some deep-sea
    species, forming a rare reproductive strategy known as sexual parasitism.
