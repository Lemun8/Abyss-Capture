  description: 'The blobfish (Psychrolutes marcidus) is a deep-sea fish found off
    the coasts of Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand. It lives at depths of 600
    to 1,200 meters, where extreme pressure makes traditional swim bladders ineffective.



    Instead,
    the blobfish has a gelatinous body with a density slightly less than water, allowing
    it to float just above the seafloor with minimal energy use. Although it has
    little muscle, this suits its lifestyle, as it feeds mainly on small deep-sea
    crustaceans drifting within reach.
