  displayName: Giant Isopod
  description: 'Scientific Name: Bathynomus (genus, with B. giganteus being the most
    known species).



    Classification: Crustacean (related to shrimp, crabs,
    and woodlice).



    Habitat: Deep sea floor (500-7,000 ft or 150-2200m) in
    the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, preferring muddy or clay bottoms.



    Physical
    Characteristics: have a hard, segmented exoskeleton, 14 legs, large compound
    eyes, and two pairs of antennae.



    Size: Up to 16-20 inches (40-50 cm) long



    Diet:
    Primarily scavengers of large organic falls (whale, fish, squid) but also eat
    slow-moving prey like sponges and sea cucumbers; can eat vast amounts at once
    and survive long periods without food.



    Lifespan: Scientists estimate their
    lifespan to be in the decades.



    Giant isopods are large deep-sea crustaceans
    from the genus Bathynomus, found in the cold waters of the Atlantic, Pacific,
    and Indian Oceans. They resemble oversized woodlice and include nearly 20 species,
    with Bathynomus giganteus often regarded as the largest, though some related
    species may reach similar sizes.



    First described in 1879, giant isopods
    became famous for challenging the idea of a lifeless deep ocean. While not important
    to commercial fisheries, they are known to damage fishing nets and are sometimes
    displayed in public aquariums in Japan and the Americas.'
