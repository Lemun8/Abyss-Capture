  displayName: Compass Jellyfish
  description: 'The compass jellyfish (Chrysaora hysoscella) is a common true jellyfish
    found in temperate coastal waters of the northeastern Atlantic, including the
    North Sea and Mediterranean Sea. It is easily recognized by the brown, V-shaped
    markings on its bell and has a life cycle that includes a seabed polyp stage
    before developing into a free-swimming adult.



    Feeding on plankton and
    small marine invertebrates, the compass jellyfish has few natural predators and
    is often affected by a parasite without major population impact. Its growing
    numbers contribute to jellyfish overpopulation, which can interfere with recreation,
    disrupt fishing activities, and affect marine ecosystems.'
