  description: 'Mackerel are pelagic fish from the family Scombridae, found in temperate
    and tropical seas where they live along coasts and in open ocean waters. They
    are easily recognized by their forked tails and green-blue, tiger-like stripes,
    and many species migrate in large schools to shallow coastal areas to spawn before
    returning to feeding grounds or deeper waters.



    Mackerel play an important
    role in the marine food chain, serving as prey for seabirds, whales, dolphins,
    sharks, and large predatory fish such as tuna. Rich in omega-3 oils, they are
    heavily harvested by humans, with millions of tons caught annually, and are also
    prized by sport fishermen for their strong fighting ability.
