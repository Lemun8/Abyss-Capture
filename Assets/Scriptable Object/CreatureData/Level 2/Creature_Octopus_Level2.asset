  displayName: Giant Pacific Octopus
  description: 'The giant Pacific octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini) is the largest
    octopus species in the world, inhabiting the cold, nutrient-rich waters of the
    North Pacific Ocean. Its range extends from Baja California up through the western
    coast of North America and across to Russia, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula,
    living from shallow intertidal zones down to depths of about 2,000 meters.



    This
    highly intelligent cephalopod plays an important role in maintaining marine ecosystem
    balance and is widely studied in cognitive research. Due to its size and adaptability,
    the giant Pacific octopus is also commonly seen in aquariums and contributes
    significantly to both scientific research and regional fisheries.
