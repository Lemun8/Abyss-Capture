  displayName: Great White Shark
  description: 'The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) is the largest living
    predatory fish, recognized by its gray upper body, white underside, and rows
    of sharp, serrated teeth. Found in tropical and temperate oceans worldwide, it
    is a powerful, partially warm-blooded hunter that feeds on fish, other sharks,
    marine mammals, and carrion, and is capable of long-distance migrations across
    entire oceans.



    Despite its fearsome reputation in popular culture, great
    white sharks rarely attack humans and are typically solitary, gathering only
    at feeding sites. The species is ovoviviparous, with pups born live after developing
    inside the mother, and juveniles remain in shallow waters until large enough
    to hunt bigger prey. Currently listed as vulnerable, great white sharks face
    threats from fishing, bycatch, and habitat pressure, leading to global conservation
    efforts to protect them.
