  description: 'Anglerfish are ray-finned fishes belonging to the order Lophiiformes,
    named for their unique hunting method in which a modified dorsal fin acts as
    a lure to attract prey. This lure, consisting of the illicium and its glowing
    tip called the esca, varies across species and is adapted to draw in specific
    prey through different visual or bioluminescent signals.



    Found worldwide,
    anglerfish inhabit a wide range of environments, from shallow coastal waters
    to the deep sea, where many species are either bottom-dwellers or pelagic. They
    are also famous for extreme sexual dimorphism, with tiny males attaching to much
    larger females in some deep-sea species, forming a rare reproductive strategy
    known as sexual parasitism.
