  displayName: Barreleye Fish
  description: "Scientific Name: Macropinna microstoma\n\r\nCommon Names: Barreleye
    fish, Spook fish, Pacific barreleye\n\r\nHabitat: Deep-sea twilight zone (mesopelagic
    zone), roughly 600\u2013800 meters deep, but can range from 400 to 2,500 meters.\n\r\nPhysical
    Characteristics: Features a transparent, fluid-filled shield on its head. The
    \"eyes\" (green orbs) are actually inside this dome.\n\r\nSize: Small, typically
    up to 6 inches (15 cm) in length\n\r\nDiet: Primarily eats zooplankton, crustaceans,
    and siphonophores.\n\r\nLifespan: Not well-documented due to extreme depths,
    but believed to be solitary.\r\n\r\nBarreleyes, also known as spookfish (a name
    also applied to several species of chimaera), are small deep-sea argentiniform
    fish comprising the family Opisthoproctidae found in tropical-to-temperate waters
    of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.\n\r\nThese fish are named because
    of their barrel-shaped, tubular eyes, which are generally directed upwards to
    detect the silhouettes of available prey; however, the fish are capable of directing
    their eyes forward, as well."
