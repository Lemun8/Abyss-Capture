  description: 'Scientific Name: Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni



    Habitat: Deep
    waters (1,000-2,000m+) of the Southern Ocean, circumpolar around Antarctica.



    Physical
    Characteristics: Reddish-brown, with a large mantle; largest eyes in the animal
    kingdom, up to 27-40 cm (10.6-16 inches) across, helping them see in the dark
    deep sea; Arms/Tentacles Equipped with toothed suckers and swivel hooks for grasping
    prey.



    Size: Largest invertebrate by mass; reaches lengths of 9-10 meters
    (30-33 feet) and weights over 495 kg (1,091 lbs).



    Diet: Carnivorous, eating
    fish (like Patagonian toothfish), other squid, and small animals.



    Lifespan:
    Short, estimated at only 1-2 years.



    The colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis
    hamiltoni) is a massive deep-sea squid from the Southern Ocean and is considered
    the largest squid species by mass, as well as the largest living invertebrate.
    Reaching confirmed weights of nearly 500 kg and possibly up to 700 kg, it has
    a maximum body length of about 4.2 meters, with much longer tentacles used only
    during feeding. It also possesses the largest eyes of any known animal, allowing
    it to detect prey and predators in the dark depths.



    This species belongs
    to the glass squid family (Cranchiidae) but is unique for having hooks on its
    arms and tentacles. Living in circumantarctic waters, the colossal squid is believed
    to be an ambush predator that feeds mainly on fish and serves as an important
    prey species for sperm whales, playing a key role in the deep-sea food chain.'
