    The pelican eel (Eurypharynx pelecanoides)
    is a deep-sea eel and the only known species in both its genus and family. It
    belongs to a unique group of true eels characterized by an extremely large, pelican-like
    mouth, which gives the species its name and common nickname, gulper eel.



    Found
    in the deep ocean, the pelican eel has been described under many names, though
    all evidence suggests only one species exists. Its expandable mouth allows it
    to capture prey much larger than itself, making it well adapted to the scarce-food
    conditions of the deep sea.'
