  description: 'Giant isopods are large deep-sea crustaceans from the genus Bathynomus,
    found in the cold waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. They resemble
    oversized woodlice and include nearly 20 species, with Bathynomus giganteus often
    regarded as the largest, though some related species may reach similar sizes.



    First
    described in 1879, giant isopods became famous for challenging the idea of a
    lifeless deep ocean. While not important to commercial fisheries, they are known
    to damage fishing nets and are sometimes displayed in public aquariums in Japan
    and the Americas.'
