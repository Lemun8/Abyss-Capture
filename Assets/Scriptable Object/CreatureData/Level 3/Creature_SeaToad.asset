  description: "Scientific Name: Eurypharynx pelecanoides.\n\r\nHabitat: Deep waters
    (continental shelves/slopes) in Atlantic, Indian, Pacific Oceans. range shallow
    to at least 8,000 ft (2,460 m).\n\r\nPhysical Characteristics: Globose body,
    large upward-pointing mouth, loose skin with small spiny scales, often red/pink,
    unique \"fishing rod\" lure (esca) on head.\n\r\nSize: Generally under 12 inches
    (30 cm).\n\r\nDiet: Small fish, invertebrates.\n\r\nLifespan: Average 5-10 years
    in the wild, but can live much longer; 10-15 years or more in captivity, with
    records of over 35 years. \r\n\r\nSea toads, also known as coffinfishes, belong
    to the deep-sea fish family Chaunacidae, part of the anglerfish order Lophiiformes.
    They are bottom-dwelling fishes found on continental slopes across the Atlantic,
    Indian, and Pacific Oceans, living at extreme depths of up to 2,460 meters, often
    near volcanic or mineral-rich seabeds.\n\r\nThe family consists of two genera,
    Chaunax and Chaunacops, with Chaunacops generally inhabiting deeper waters, though
    their ranges overlap. These rare deep-sea anglerfishes have also been discovered
    near Australia and New Caledonia, highlighting their wide but specialized distribution
    in the deep ocean."
