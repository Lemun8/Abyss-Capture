  displayName: Vampire Squid
  description: 'Scientific Name: Vampyroteuthis infernalis ("vampire squid from hell").



    Habitat:
    Deep, cold, low-oxygen waters (oxygen minimum zone) in tropical and temperate
    oceans, 300-3000m deep.



    Physical Characteristics: Velvety black or reddish,
    with large, luminous blue or red eyes, eight webbed arms, and two long, sticky
    filaments.



    Size: Up to 30 cm (1 foot) long, with a small gelatinous body.



    Diet:
    Detritivore, consuming "marine snow" (organic debris) and fecal pellets, not
    live prey.



    Lifespan: An adult stage of 3-8 years is hypothesized based
    on egg counts, suggesting total life is even longer.



    The vampire squid
    (Vampyroteuthis infernalis, lit. ''vampire squid from hell'') is a small cephalopod
    found throughout temperate and tropical oceans in extreme deep sea conditions.
    The vampire squid uses its bioluminescent organs and its unique oxygen metabolism
    to thrive in the parts of the ocean with the lowest concentrations of oxygen.
    It has two long retractile filaments, located between the first two pairs of
    arms on its dorsal side, which distinguish it from both octopuses and squids,
    though its closest relatives are octopods. As a phylogenetic relict, it is the
    only known surviving member of the order Vampyromorphida.

    The first specimens
    were collected on the Valdivia Expedition and were originally described as an
    octopus in 1903 by German teuthologist Carl Chun, but later assigned to a new
    order together with several extinct taxa.'
